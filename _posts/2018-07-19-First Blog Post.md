Blogs are the platform  were people write about their experiences, knowledge and so and so. When I decided to start a blog the parameters which I considered most importantly was speed security and cost. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) was the perfect solution for that.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is basically a static site generator. It doesn't have a database or an admin panel ,so I  don't have to bother about the database security and that sort of things.

Unlike wordpress or other bloging platforms jekyll docent use lot of plugins.
Since there are minimum number of plugins used sites are loaded faster.

Jekyll doesn't make any database call .all contents are served statically.
using static files makes the sites faster.
